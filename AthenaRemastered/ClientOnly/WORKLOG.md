# ClientOnly Worklog (Athena Web 2)

Purpose: track every step, fix, and next action while migrating from the legacy backend/DLL approach to a Bus-compatible client-only architecture.

## Scope Rules
- Use only Bus-approved original mod runtime (extension + relay behavior as shipped).
- Do not modify Bus DLLs/relay binaries.
- Build around local client-side bridge + browser UI.
- This folder is the new working surface for cleanup and future GitHub publication.

## Timeline

### 2026-04-01 — Pivot Validation
- Confirmed BattleEye risk with custom extension path.
- Validated PoC relay bridge approach in `Athena Web 2/poc`:
  - Relay TCP 28800 connection works.
  - Browser receives live unit feed through bridge WebSocket.

### 2026-04-01 — START Investigation (decompilation-backed)
- Investigated `Athena Desktop.exe` and `Relay.exe` behavior.
- Verified protocol framing:
  - separator: `<ath_sep>`
  - terminator: `<ath_sep>end`
- Verified Desktop START action sends:
  - `command<ath_sep>mapexport`
- Verified map import message types consumed by Desktop:
  - `mapbegin`, `maprow`, `mapobjects`, `maplocations`, `maproads`, `mapfoliage`, `mapend`

### 2026-04-01 — PoC Bridge Enhancements
- Added browser START action support in bridge (`startMapExport`).
- Bridge now sends exact relay command to trigger map export.
- Added map import status events to browser:
  - stage, world, per-type counters
- Added map import completion summary payload:
  - road/object/location/foliage counts and parsed totals
- Fixed browser runtime bug (`world-name` wrong element id) causing blank behavior on updates.

### 2026-04-01 — New Clean Workspace
- Created new clean folder for future-focused work:
  - `AthenaRemastered/ClientOnly/`
- Copied remastered frontend into:
  - `AthenaRemastered/ClientOnly/ui`
- Copied proven bridge into:
  - `AthenaRemastered/ClientOnly/bridge`

### 2026-04-01 — ClientOnly UI Wiring (in progress)
- Replaced `ClientOnly/ui` hook data source:
  - old: SignalR + ASP.NET backend
  - new: Relay bridge WebSocket
- Implemented mapping from bridge state -> UI `GameFrame` shape.
- Wired `requestWorldExport('world')` -> bridge `startMapExport` message.
- Changed dev API base to bridge port `:3000`.

### 2026-04-01 — Validation + Tracking Setup
- Updated `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with ClientOnly pivot rules and mandatory worklog usage.
- Added this `WORKLOG.md` as the single running technical record for migration work.
- Installed dependencies and built `ClientOnly/ui` successfully (`npm run build` passed).
- Result: new isolated path is now buildable and ready for geometry decoding work.

### 2026-04-01 — Bridge Compatibility Endpoints + Geometry Hydration
- Added compatibility API endpoints to `ClientOnly/bridge/server.js`:
  - `/api/game/worldinfo`
  - `/api/game/roads`
  - `/api/game/forests`
  - `/api/game/locations`
  - `/api/game/structures`
  - `/api/game/elevations`
  - `/api/game/trees`
  - `/api/game/exportstatus`
  - `/api/staticmap/{world}`
  - `/api/staticmap/{world}/contours/{z}` (empty placeholder)
  - `/api/staticmap/{world}/landmask` (full-land placeholder mask)
- Bridge now reads local Athena map cache from `%USERPROFILE%/Documents/Athena/Maps/{world}` (or `ATHENA_MAPS_DIR` override).
- Added transformations from Athena cache shapes into remastered UI geometry types (roads/locations/structures/trees/worldinfo).
- Updated `ClientOnly/ui/src/hooks/useAthenaHub.ts` to hydrate geometry from bridge endpoints on connect/state/map-import completion.

### 2026-04-01 — Fixes During Integration
- Fixed TypeScript hook dependency error in `useAthenaHub.ts` (`hydrateGeometry` self-reference issue).
- Resolved port confusion by stopping old PoC server instance so `ClientOnly/bridge` owns port 3000.

### 2026-04-01 — Runtime Validation
- `ClientOnly/ui` build passed after integration changes.
- `ClientOnly/bridge` syntax check passed.
- Endpoint smoke test passed and returned JSON payloads:
  - world info
  - roads
  - locations
  - structures
  - trees
  - static map metadata

### 2026-04-01 — Geometry Fidelity Pass (roads + forests)
- Improved road conversion in `ClientOnly/bridge/server.js`:
  - uses first/last cached road nodes to produce real line segments (`beg1` -> `end2`)
  - infers fallback length from segment distance when cache length is missing/zero
  - keeps width/type mapping for existing map styling
- Implemented forest cell conversion from cache index tokens (`"x,y"`) to Athena `ForestsData` cells:
  - parses both `CellsLight` and `CellsHeavy`
  - computes sample size from detected index range vs. world size
  - maps light/heavy to different density levels for rendering
- Re-ran bridge syntax validation (`node --check server.js`) and confirmed clean parse.

### 2026-04-01 — Elevation + Land/Ocean + Runway Data Pass
- Replaced static-map placeholders in `ClientOnly/bridge/server.js`:
  - `/api/staticmap/{world}` now returns real `availableZ` from `Height/Z*.txt` files.
  - `/api/staticmap/{world}/contours/{z}` now parses `PointGroups` into world-metre contour polylines.
  - `/api/staticmap/{world}/landmask` now builds raster masks from coastline contour rings with caching and fast fallback.
- Implemented `/api/game/elevations` bridge response:
  - emits coarse elevation cells derived from major contour levels (20m bands).
  - payload now includes `sampleSize`, `worldSize`, and populated `cells`.
- Added bridge-side in-memory caches for world metadata, contour lines, and land masks to reduce repeated heavy parsing.
- Verified endpoint responses after bridge restart:
  - `Altis`: `availableZ=58`, `contours/0 lines=151`, valid landmask payload returned.
  - Active world endpoint now returns non-null elevation payload with populated cells.

### 2026-04-01 — Runtime Elevation Decode Pass (maprow + elevation)
- Added robust runtime elevation parsing in `ClientOnly/bridge/server.js`:
  - decodes `maprow` payloads into `{x,y,z}` cells using multiple formats (JSON object/array/csv triples).
  - added relay command support for `elevation` and `elevationscomplete` message variants.
  - stores decoded runtime terrain samples in `mapImportData.runtimeElevations`.
- Updated `/api/game/elevations` behavior:
  - now prefers decoded runtime samples when available.
  - falls back to contour-derived coarse elevations only when runtime samples are absent.
  - infers runtime sample size from decoded point spacing.
- Validation:
  - bridge syntax check passed.
  - active world endpoint currently returns dense elevation payload (`cells=372311`, `sampleSize=4` on Malden).

### 2026-04-01 — Road Fidelity Pass (multi-segment reconstruction)
- Upgraded road conversion in `ClientOnly/bridge/server.js`:
  - non-`hide` roads now emit one road record per adjacent node pair (`road-{idx}-{segment}`) for line fidelity.
  - per-segment length and direction are now inferred from node geometry.
  - center point (`posX`,`posY`) is now midpoint of each segment for consistent map usage.
- Preserved runway/airport surfaces behavior:
  - `hide` roads remain single area tiles (rectangle rendering path unchanged).
- Validation after bridge restart:
  - `/api/game/roads` now returns segmented geometry (`roads=6438`, `hide=415`, `nonHide=6023`).
  - runway tile count remains stable while non-hide road detail increased significantly.

### 2026-04-01 — Runtime Elevation Parser Diagnostics
- Added parser telemetry to `ClientOnly/bridge/server.js` runtime map import state:
  - counts parsed vs failed runtime elevation messages.
  - stores sample unparsed payloads (capped) for fast format debugging.
- Added new debug endpoint:
  - `/api/game/elevationdebug`
  - returns active world, in-progress state, maprow count, runtime cell count, parse success/failure counts, success rate, and payload samples.
- Included elevation parse metrics in `mapImportDataReady` broadcast summary.
- Validation:
  - bridge syntax check passed.
  - endpoint smoke test returned expected structured payload on active world.

### 2026-04-01 — Relay Command Trace for Stalled Export
- Added bridge-side relay command ring buffer in `ClientOnly/bridge/server.js`:
  - records recent command names with timestamp and payload preview.
  - keeps the latest 120 relay commands for short-window troubleshooting.
- Added new endpoint:
  - `/api/game/relaydebug`
  - returns relay connection state, export stage/last command, and recent relay command tail.
- Verified behavior after restart:
  - bridge remains relay-connected and continuously receives `frame` traffic.
  - stalled export reproduces as `phase=requested`, `stalled=true`, `lastCommand=mapexport-requested` when no map chunks arrive.
  - during idle monitoring, relay trace shows only `frame` commands (no `mapbegin`/`maprow` yet captured in this window).

### 2026-04-01 — GUID-Routed Export Request Attempt
- Found protocol clue in legacy Athena notes: relay supports client GUID mapping for map export routing.
- Updated `ClientOnly/bridge/server.js` export trigger behavior:
  - sends GUID-targeted command frame: `command<ath_sep>{bridgeGuid}<ath_sep>mapexport<ath_sep>end`
  - keeps legacy fallback frame: `command<ath_sep>mapexport<ath_sep>end`
- Added outbound trace label `command@self` to verify GUID-routed request is emitted on each export click.
- Next validation step: confirm whether this produces inbound `mapbegin/maprow/...` chunks instead of `requested/stalled`.

### 2026-04-01 — Export Routing Revalidation + Frame Introspection
- Live capture during user exports showed:
  - outbound: `command<ath_sep>mapexport`
  - inbound: `success`
  - no inbound `mapbegin/maprow/mapobjects/maproads/mapfoliage/mapend` commands observed.
- GUID-routed variant produced `malformed` from relay in current setup, so export trigger was reverted to legacy accepted form only.
- Added frame diagnostics endpoint in bridge:
  - `/api/game/framedebug`
  - reports frame schema keys, GUID hints, and map/export-related field hints to detect whether export payload is embedded in `frame` JSON.

### 2026-04-01 — Post-Export Delivery Gap (Reproduced)
- User-side game messages confirm full export pipeline progression:
  - adding foliage/structures/roads to buffer
  - all world data supplied to relay for delivery
- Immediate bridge diagnostics after export click:
  - `/api/game/exportstatus`: `phase=requested`, `stalled=true`, all geometry counters remain `0`
  - `/api/game/relaydebug`: outbound `command -> mapexport`, inbound `success` only
  - `/api/game/elevationdebug`: no parsed/failed maprow payloads
  - `/api/game/framedebug`: still no frame payload observations in this run window
- Conclusion for this stage:
  - relay acknowledges request but does not deliver map chunk stream to the current bridge consumer path.

### 2026-04-01 — Deep Relay Diagnostics Added
- Added configurable relay registration command type in bridge config:
  - `RELAY_CLIENT_TYPE` (default `General`)
  - handshake now logs the active registration type at connect time.
- Added raw relay dump endpoint for non-keepalive traffic:
  - `/api/game/rawrelaydebug?limit=10&clear=1`
  - captures raw message snippets with command tag and timestamp for unknown/new command forms.
- Updated `/api/game/relaydebug` payload to include current `relayClientType`.

### 2026-04-01 — Raw Relay Capture (General Registration)
- Post-export capture with clean raw buffer (`General` registration) returned:
  - outbound: `command -> mapexport`
  - inbound raw non-keepalive messages: exactly one entry, `success`
- No map chunk command forms observed (`mapbegin/maprow/mapobjects/maproads/mapfoliage/mapend` all absent).
- Export status remains `requested/stalled` with zero geometry counters in bridge state.

### 2026-04-01 — Desktop-Open A/B Check
- Ran export test with Athena Desktop open while bridge stayed on `General` registration.
- Capture outcome remained unchanged:
  - outbound: `command -> mapexport`
  - inbound raw non-keepalive: only `success`
  - no map chunk command stream delivered to bridge.
- Conclusion: merely running Desktop does not change relay delivery behavior to this bridge client in current setup.

### 2026-04-01 — MapExport Strategy Harness
- Added configurable export payload strategy to bridge:
  - env var: `MAPEXPORT_STRATEGY`
  - supported values: `basic` (default), `guid-csv`, `guid-pipe`, `guid-colon`, `guid-space`, `all-guid`
- Export trigger now sends one or more `command` payload variants according to strategy.
- Purpose: quickly test relay routing expectations without further code edits between runs.

### 2026-04-01 — Live Cache World Fallback (Documents/Athena/Maps)
- Added active-world fallback logic in `ClientOnly/bridge/server.js`:
  - if relay-hinted world is missing/unusable, bridge now selects the most recently updated world folder under `%USERPROFILE%/Documents/Athena/Maps`.
  - probe considers core map files and live chunk directories (`Rows`, `Roads`) with short TTL caching for performance.
- Validation after restart:
  - `/api/game/worldinfo` now resolves to live generated cache world (`Stratis`).
  - `/api/game/roads` returns populated road geometry for resolved world.

### 2026-04-01 — World Cache Selection Controls
- Added environment controls to choose between live and stable map cache selection:
  - `WORLD_SELECTION_MODE=fresh|stable`
    - `fresh` (default): prefers most recently updated world, including live chunk dirs (`Rows`, `Roads`).
    - `stable`: ignores live chunk dir mtimes and prefers worlds based on core cache files only.
  - `WORLD_CACHE_OVERRIDE=<WorldName>` to force a specific world folder (if present).
- This allows testing the "desktop loads stored map offline" behavior without deleting Stratis cache data.

### 2026-04-01 — Runtime Cache Mode API (No Restart Needed)
- Added API endpoint in bridge for live cache selection control:
  - `GET /api/game/cachemode` returns current mode/override and resolved active world.
  - `GET /api/game/cachemode?mode=fresh|stable&world=<WorldName>` updates settings via query.
  - `POST /api/game/cachemode` with JSON `{ mode, worldOverride }` updates settings.
- Cache mode changes now clear in-memory world/contour/landmask memoization to apply immediately.
- Validation:
  - default read returned `fresh` + `Stratis`.
  - switching to `stable+Altis` changed active world to `Altis` instantly.
  - switching back to `fresh` with cleared override returned to `Stratis`.

### 2026-04-01 — UI Map Source Controls
- Added map source controls in `ClientOnly/ui/src/components/Sidebar.tsx` (COMMON tab):
  - active cache world display
  - mode selector (`fresh` / `stable`)
  - world override input
  - `Apply` and `Refresh` actions
- Wired UI to bridge runtime cache API in `ClientOnly/ui/src/hooks/useAthenaHub.ts`:
  - loads current cache mode via `/api/game/cachemode`
  - applies updates via `POST /api/game/cachemode`

### 2026-04-01 — Empty-Ocean Fix (Desktop Cache Land Base)
- Investigated empty blue map in browser despite active world controls.
- Root cause identified in land base pipeline:
  - UI attempted contour polygon fill before raster mask fallback; contour branch could short-circuit without visible land fill.
  - Bridge landmask endpoint returned all-land fallback at high requested grid sizes when contour operation estimate exceeded threshold.
- Updated `ClientOnly/ui/src/components/AthenaMap.tsx`:
  - land build now prioritizes `/api/staticmap/{world}/landmask` first.
  - reduced requested landmask resolution from 1024 to 512 for faster/safer generation.
  - validates non-empty mask data and falls back to contour/elevation paths if needed.
- Updated `ClientOnly/bridge/server.js` landmask endpoint:
  - keeps requested grid for cache keying but auto-reduces effective raster grid (down to 64 min) when coastline complexity is high.
  - now returns a real generated coastline mask instead of defaulting to all-land for complex worlds.
- Validation after bridge restart:
  - `GET /api/staticmap/Stratis/landmask?gridSize=512` returned `width=256,height=256` with mixed land/ocean ratio (`18807/65536`, ~0.287).
  - `ClientOnly/ui` build passed (`npm run build`).
- Next concrete task:
  - Add optional direct `Rows`-based terrain texture overlay path (when row cache files exist) to match original desktop visual style beyond land/ocean silhouette.

### 2026-04-01 — Blue-Map Runtime Safety Fallback
- Added a last-resort land fill fallback in `ClientOnly/ui/src/components/AthenaMap.tsx`.
- New behavior:
  - if landmask fetch/render fails,
  - and contour fallback is unavailable,
  - and runtime elevations are missing/invalid,
  - map now renders a readable neutral land base rectangle instead of staying full ocean-blue.
- This keeps operator usability (units/roads context) while cache terrain sources recover.

### 2026-04-01 — Geometry Hydration Fault-Tolerance
- Diagnosed case where units were live but roads/structures/locations were missing in UI.
- Updated `ClientOnly/ui/src/hooks/useAthenaHub.ts` geometry hydration:
  - replaced brittle endpoint parsing with per-endpoint `fetchJsonSafe` handling.
  - each dataset now hydrates independently (`worldinfo`, `roads`, `forests`, `locations`, `structures`, `elevations`, `exportstatus`).
  - a single endpoint failure no longer prevents all geometry layers from appearing.
- Validation:
  - bridge endpoints are reachable and populated (`roads`, `structures`, `forests`, `locations`, `elevations`).
  - UI build passed after hook update.

### 2026-04-01 — Static Unit/No Group Labels Diagnosis
- Symptom reported: only land fallback visible; unit marker appears static; no group labels.
- Verified bridge diagnostics:
  - `/api/game/framedebug` `seenCount` stalled (and later zero after clean restart).
  - relay command tail showed no live `frame` stream, only occasional `success` acknowledgements.
- Conclusion:
  - movement/heading/group labels depend on continuous relay `frame` telemetry.
  - when relay stops sending `frame`, UI can only show stale/initial marker snapshots.
- Attempted bridge-side heartbeat to provoke frame updates, then rolled it back after it did not restore streaming.
- Current bridge state returned to clean mode (`General` registration, no synthetic heartbeat spam).
- Next concrete task:
  - validate Arma->Relay live frame production path (mission script/export loop and extension feed) until `/api/game/framedebug.seenCount` increments continuously.

### 2026-04-01 — Relay Endpoint/Type Verification + Pipe Recovery
- Verified active relay process and path:
  - `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Arma 3\!Workshop\@Athena - An Arma 2nd Screen Application\Relay.exe`
  - listening on port `28800`.
- Confirmed accepted relay client type for bridge remains `General`.
  - `Athena` and other guessed types return `error: unrecognized type`.
- Probed likely frame-poll command payloads (`frame`, `state`, `update`, `subscribe`, etc.): all returned `success` without enabling continuous frame stream.
- Inspected active `Relay.exe.log` and found repeated historical pipe instability (`SendPipeMessage :: Error: Pipe is broken`).
- Performed clean relay restart.
- Post-restart bridge observations:
  - frame count increased from 1 to 2 once,
  - but still not continuous (stalls at fixed `lastSeenAt`).
- Interpretation:
  - bridge/web path is healthy and connected,
  - remaining blocker is upstream continuous frame production from Arma extension -> Relay pipe for this run.

### 2026-04-01 — Dev URL Routing Fix (Splash Screen Confusion)
- Confirmed URL split:
  - `http://localhost:3000` = legacy bridge PoC page (`Athena Web PoC`)
  - `http://localhost:5173` = active React UI
- Added bridge root redirect in `ClientOnly/bridge/server.js`:
  - requests to `/` on port `3000` now redirect to `http://{host}:5173/` by default.
  - can be disabled with `UI_DEV_REDIRECT=false` if needed.
- Purpose:
  - prevent accidental landing on splash page while testing ClientOnly UI.
  - refreshes geometry immediately after apply/refresh
- Threaded cache-mode state/actions through `ClientOnly/ui/src/App.tsx` into the sidebar.
- Validation:
  - `npm run build` passed after UI integration changes.

### 2026-04-01 — Mission Init Instrumentation (Live Frame Stall)
- Revalidated ACS path is not required for original Relay/Desktop flow.
- Restarted bridge and relay stack; bridge remains relay-connected on `General` registration.
- Verified active mission launch path from latest RPT:
  - `...\missions\Editor%20Athena%20Test.Malden\`
- Added mission-side `init.sqf` in that folder and upgraded it with explicit `diag_log` probes:
  - `Athena Mission Init: starting`
  - `Athena Mission Init: player ready (...)`
  - `Athena Mission Init: launched init/loop scripts`
- Startup now triggers both preferred and fallback script paths:
  - `execVM "\athena\init.sqf"`
  - `execVM "\athena\loopPut.sqf"`
  - `execVM "\athena\loopGet.sqf"`
- Current status:
  - bridge API healthy, relay connected.
  - `framedebug.seenCount` still stalled at `1` until mission is restarted so new init instrumentation executes.

### 2026-04-01 — Eden Mission Path Sweep + Script Path Correction
- Applied `init.sqf` startup bootstrap to all local Eden mission folders under:
  - `...\NightHawk\missions\*Athena*`
  - `...\NightHawk\missions\~Editor*`
  - `...\NightHawk\missions\~tempMissionSP*`
- Added diagnostics + startup commands in each mission init:
  - `diag_log "Athena Mission Init: ..."`
  - `execVM "\athena\init.sqf"`
  - `execVM "\athena\loopPut.sqf"`
  - `execVM "\athena\loopGet.sqf"`
- Fixed path escaping bug introduced during batch injection:
  - normalized `"\\athena\\..."` to `"\athena\..."` in mission init files.

### 2026-04-01 — Relay Queue Pull Breakthrough (Frame Stream Restored)
- Root cause identified for stalled unit updates:
  - relay appears to require queue polling via `next` command for continuous delivery.
  - prior bridge behavior relied on passive receive (or `command` polling) and only saw sparse/cached frames.
- Updated bridge protocol polling in `ClientOnly/bridge/server.js`:
  - added configurable poll command type (`relayFramePollType`).
  - validated `next<ath_sep><ath_sep>end` polling restores continuous frames.
- Set new defaults:
  - `RELAY_FRAME_POLL_TYPE=next`
  - `RELAY_FRAME_POLL_INTERVAL_MS=250`
  - command payload remains empty.
  - guard added so empty `command` polls are not sent.
- Validation:
  - `/api/game/framedebug` now increments continuously (seen count rising each sample).
  - `/api/game/relaydebug` shows outbound `next` and inbound steady `frame` traffic.

### 2026-04-01 — End-of-Day Mission Init Cleanup
- Removed temporary mission-wide debug bootstrap injections created during triage.
- Current mission init footprint is now minimal and scoped to the active test mission only:
  - `Editor%20Athena%20Test.Malden/init.sqf`
  - content: `[] execVM "\athena\init.sqf";`
- Verification:
  - only one `init.sqf` remains under `...\NightHawk\missions`.
  - no remaining files contain `Athena Mission Init:` debug markers.

### 2026-04-02 — World-Change Auto-Detection Audit + Cache Fix
- Audited full world-change pipeline for fresh map scenario:
  1. Bridge receives new `map` name from relay frames → `gameState.map` updates immediately
  2. `buildClientState()` returns new world via `gameState.map || detectActiveWorld()`
  3. UI detects world change (`relayWorld !== lastHydratedWorld`) → triggers `hydrateGeometry()`
  4. REST endpoints use `detectActiveWorld()` → returns new world name → reads Athena Desktop disk cache
  5. `AthenaMap.tsx` resets `staticCacheRef` on world change → clears all rendered layers
- **Bug found and fixed**: `worldCacheMemo` was never invalidated when `mapend` arrived after export.
  - Result: if REST endpoints were called before Athena Desktop finished writing cache files, the stale/empty result was memoized and never refreshed.
  - Fix: added `worldCacheMemo.clear()`, `contourCacheMemo.clear()`, `landMaskCacheMemo.clear()` inside `handleMapImportMessage()` on `mapend`.
  - After fix, `mapImportDataReady` → UI `hydrateGeometry()` → REST endpoints re-read fresh disk cache.
- Confirmed safe behavior for already-cached worlds:
  - `loadWorldCache()` returns `null` (not memoized) when world dir doesn't exist.
  - Switching between cached worlds (Altis/Malden/Stratis/etc.) creates separate memo entries per world — no cross-contamination.
- Confirmed UI "Export World Data" button exists in Sidebar → sends `startMapExport` WS message → bridge sends `command<ath_sep>mapexport` to relay.
- Expected flow for fresh map test:
  1. Start Arma on new map → relay frames arrive with new `map` name
  2. Bridge updates `gameState.map` → UI detects world change → layers clear + re-hydrate from cache (if exists)
  3. User clicks "Export World Data" → Athena Desktop exports + writes cache files
  4. Relay delivers `mapbegin`→`mapend` → bridge clears all memos → broadcasts `mapImportDataReady`
  5. UI re-hydrates from REST → reads fresh disk cache → all layers render

### 2026-04-02 — Flat Military Cartography Style Overhaul
- Goal: match Bus's original Athena Desktop visual style — clean, flat, solid, sharp. No gradients, no fading, no soft edges. "16-bit precision military nav" aesthetic.
- **Rendering priority swap**: Z=0 contour vector polygon fill is now primary land path (smooth coastlines), raster mask demoted to fallback.
- **All opacities hardened to 1.0** (was 0.35–0.92 on various layers):
  - Road fills: 0.85 → 1.0
  - Road borders: 0.7 → 1.0
  - Airport surface strokes: 0.35 → 1.0
  - Contour lines: 0.58/0.7/0.76 → 1.0 (all three tiers)
  - Walls/fences: 0.88 → 1.0
  - Structure strokes: 0.92 → 1.0
  - Structure fills: 0.55 → 1.0
  - Waypoint lines: 0.85 → 1.0
  - Projectile trails: 0.9 → 1.0
  - Topo overlay: 0.75 → 1.0
  - Land fallback rectangle: 0.9 → 1.0
- **Forest cells fully opaque** (was semi-transparent alpha blending):
  - Dense (level 3): alpha 155 → 255 (solid dark green)
  - Medium (level 2): alpha 110 → 255 (new distinct mid-green: 148,182,140)
  - Sparse (level 1): alpha 78 → 255 (solid light green: 188,210,180)
- **Trees**: fill alpha 0.9 → 1.0 (solid forest green)
- **All line caps/joins changed to sharp**:
  - Coastline Z=0: round → butt/miter
  - Inland contours: round → butt/miter
  - Removed Chaikin corner-cutting smoothing on coastline (was softening grid-derived contour edges)
  - Coastline now single solid stroke (was dual outer+inner with semi-transparency)
- **Drop shadows solidified**:
  - Unit icons: rgba(0,0,0,0.5) → #000
  - Group icons: rgba(0,0,0,0.55) → #000
  - Vehicle SVG strokes: rgba(0,0,0,0.75) → #000
- **Text outlines solidified**:
  - Location labels: rgba(0,0,0,0.85) → #000
  - Unit marker labels: rgba(0,0,0,0.92) → #000
- **Global CSS added**:
  - `svg { shape-rendering: crispEdges; }` — flat SVG rendering, no anti-aliased softness
  - `canvas { image-rendering: pixelated; }` — global crisp canvas rendering
- **Dead code removed**: `smoothRing()` Chaikin function (no longer used after coastline change)
- Files changed: `AthenaMap.tsx`, `App.css`

### 2026-04-02 — Bus-Exact Rendering Values (dnSpy Decompilation)
- Decompiled Athena Desktop.exe with dnSpy and read all rendering code (MapHelper.cs, Common.cs, Marker.cs, Unit.cs, Vehicle.cs, XAML templates).
- Extracted every color, weight, alpha, and size value from Bus's original WPF renderer.
- Applied Bus-exact values to `ClientOnly/ui/src/components/AthenaMap.tsx`:
  - **Side colors**: `sideColor()` now returns Bus's ARGB(180,...) values as rgba (0.706 alpha):
    - WEST `rgba(78,118,204,0.706)`, EAST `rgba(204,78,78,0.706)`, GUER `rgba(0,128,0,0.706)`, CIV `rgba(178,0,255,0.706)`
  - **Road colors**: `roadStyle()` uses Bus named colors:
    - Highway=SandyBrown `#F4A460`, Concrete=LightGray `#D3D3D3`, Asphalt=DimGray `#696969`, Dirt=Tan `#D2B48C`, Unknown=Brown `#A52A2A`
  - **Contour lines**: `contourStyle()` uniform weight 0.75 (was variable 0.35–1.5):
    - Z=0 MediumBlue `#0000CD`, Z<0 DodgerBlue `#1E90FF`, Z>0 RosyBrown `#BC8F8F`
  - **Tree radius**: Fixed 2.0 (was zoom-scaled 1.5–3px), matching Bus's `EllipseGeometry(2.0, 2.0)`
  - **Ocean background**: `#B0E0E6` PowderBlue (already correct)
  - **Land fill**: `#FFFFF0` Ivory in all 5 render paths (was `#FEFFEF`)
  - **Coastline**: `#0000CD` MediumBlue, weight 0.75 (was `#7789C0`, weight 1.5)
  - **Forest cells**: Semi-transparent 27.5% alpha matching Bus's `ARGB(70,...)`:
    - Heavy `rgba(0,127,12,0.275)`, Light `rgba(0,181,18,0.275)` (was fully opaque 3-tier)
  - **Marching-squares contours**: Uniform 0.75 weight, exact named colors, no alpha variation
- Removed unused `is120`/`is60`/`is30` variables from marching-squares loop (were left over from old variable-weight logic).
- All changes verified with zero compile errors.

### 2026-04-05 — Map Cache Banner + Sidebar Simplification + Follow-Player UX (v0.0.2)
- **Map Cache Health Banner** (`MapCacheBanner.tsx` + `useHealthCheck.ts`):
  - New `useHealthCheck` hook polls `/api/health` every 15s.
  - Amber warning banner appears for 4 states: cache directory not found, cache empty, active world not cached, bridge unreachable.
  - Banner is user-dismissible and links to Steam Workshop for Athena Desktop download.
  - Handles HTTP 503 (degraded health) correctly — parses JSON body regardless of status code.
- **Sidebar World Picker Overhaul** (`Sidebar.tsx`, `App.tsx`, `useAthenaHub.ts`):
  - Removed confusing fresh/stable dropdown, world override text field, Apply and Refresh buttons.
  - Replaced with a single world picker `<select>` populated from cached map folders detected by health endpoint.
  - When Arma is running and sending live data, sidebar shows "Live" indicator with the active world name (dropdown hidden).
  - Added `selectWorld()` in `useAthenaHub.ts` — sets cache mode to `stable` with override for picked world, or `fresh` when cleared.
  - Added `userSelectedWorld` state in `App.tsx` with auto-clear effect: when a live game world arrives, any user-selected world is overridden automatically.
- **Follow Active Player Auto-Disable** (`AthenaMap.tsx`, `App.tsx`):
  - New `UserInteractionBridge` component inside Leaflet `MapContainer` listens for `dragstart` and `zoomstart` events.
  - When user manually drags or zooms the map, `onUserInteraction` callback fires → `setFollowActivePlayer(false)` in App.
  - Follow mode can be re-enabled via the existing sidebar button.
- Files changed: `App.tsx`, `App.css`, `AthenaMap.tsx`, `Sidebar.tsx`, `useAthenaHub.ts` (modified); `MapCacheBanner.tsx`, `useHealthCheck.ts` (new).
- Build verified: `tsc -b` and `vite build` both pass cleanly.

## Current Known Limitations
- Forest density and sample-size inference still needs visual calibration per map (Altis/Malden/others).
- Runtime maprow parser is heuristic-first; needs live-capture verification against multiple mission/maprow payload variants.
- Road segment stitching is per-object local; optional future step is endpoint dedup/merge for long polylines to reduce draw calls.

## Next Tasks
1. Validate visual rendering style matches Bus's flat military cartography
2. Runtime export data serving via REST (for custom maps without Athena Desktop cache)
3. Runtime maprow parser fix for `{y, z}` JSON format
4. Wall/structure rotation audit
5. Filter trees outside land boundary

## Quick Run Commands
```powershell
# Terminal 1: bridge
cd AthenaRemastered/ClientOnly/bridge
npm install
node server.js

# Terminal 2: UI
cd AthenaRemastered/ClientOnly/ui
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Verification Checklist
- UI loads (not blank)
- Relay connected state turns green
- Live units render and update
- START button action triggers map import status updates
- Map import reaches `mapend`
